//! Windows Performance Counters for EST Auto-Enrollment monitoring.
//!
//! This module provides Windows Performance Counter integration for monitoring
//! EST auto-enrollment operations. It allows administrators to track key metrics
//! using standard Windows tools like Performance Monitor (perfmon.exe).
//!
//! # Performance Counters
//!
//! The following counters are available:
//!
//! - **Certificates Enrolled**: Total successful enrollments
//! - **Certificates Renewed**: Total successful renewals
//! - **Enrollment Failures**: Total enrollment failures
//! - **Renewal Failures**: Total renewal failures
//! - **Days Until Expiration**: Days until certificate expires (current)
//! - **Last Check Time**: Unix timestamp of last certificate check
//! - **Operations Per Minute**: Rate of EST operations
//!
//! # Security
//!
//! Performance counters are readable by all authenticated users by default.
//! Counter registration requires administrator privileges.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run,ignore
//! use usg_est_client::windows::perfcounter::{PerformanceCounters, CounterType};
//!
//! # fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! // Create and register counters
//! let counters = PerformanceCounters::new("EST Auto-Enrollment")?;
//! counters.register()?;
//!
//! // Update counters during operation
//! counters.increment(CounterType::CertificatesEnrolled)?;
//! counters.set_value(CounterType::DaysUntilExpiration, 30)?;
//!
//! // Clean up on service shutdown
//! counters.unregister()?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
