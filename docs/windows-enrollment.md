## Overview

The EST auto-enrollment system provides a modern, standards-based alternative to ADCS auto-enrollment:

- **Standards-Based**: Uses RFC 7030 (EST) instead of proprietary protocols
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **Flexible Authentication**: Supports HTTP Basic, client certificates, and Windows Credential Manager
- **Automatic Renewal**: Background service monitors and renews certificates before expiration
- **Hardware Integration**: Supports Windows CNG, TPM, and PKCS#11 HSMs

### Comparison with ADCS Auto-Enrollment

| Feature | ADCS Auto-Enrollment | EST Auto-Enrollment |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Protocol | Proprietary (MS-WCCE) | RFC 7030 (EST) |
| Platform | Windows only | Cross-platform |
| Domain Required | Yes (Active Directory) | No |
| Certificate Stores | Windows Store only | Windows Store or PEM files |
| Key Storage | CNG, CSP | Software, CNG, TPM, PKCS#11 |
| Authentication | Kerberos, NTLM | HTTP Basic, Client Cert |
| Server Software | Windows Server + ADCS | Any EST server |

## Configuration File Format

Configuration files use TOML format with support for variable expansion. The file is typically located at:

- **Windows**: `C:\ProgramData\EST\config.toml`
- **Linux**: `/etc/est/config.toml`
- **macOS**: `/etc/est/config.toml`

You can also override the location using the `EST_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.

### Minimal Configuration

```toml
[server]
url = "https://est.example.com"

[certificate]
common_name = "${COMPUTERNAME}.${USERDNSDOMAIN}"
```

### IDE Support

All example configuration files include a JSON schema reference for IDE autocompletion:

```toml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=../../schema/est-config.schema.json
```

This enables IntelliSense, validation, and inline documentation in VS Code, IntelliJ, and other modern editors.

## Variable Expansion

Configuration values support variable expansion using `${VARIABLE_NAME}` syntax. This allows machine-specific values to be computed at runtime.

### Supported Variables

| Variable | Description | Example (Windows) | Example (Unix) |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| `${COMPUTERNAME}` | Computer/hostname | `DESKTOP-ABC123` | `webserver` |
| `${USERDNSDOMAIN}` | DNS domain suffix | `corp.contoso.com` | `example.com` |
| `${USERDOMAIN}` | NetBIOS domain | `CORP` | N/A |
| `${USERNAME}` | Current username | `jsmith` | `jsmith` |
| `${HOME}` | Home directory | `C:\Users\jsmith` | `/home/jsmith` |
| `${USERPROFILE}` | User profile dir | `C:\Users\jsmith` | `/home/jsmith` |
| `${PROGRAMDATA}` | Program data dir | `C:\ProgramData` | `/var/lib` |
| `${LOCALAPPDATA}` | Local app data | `C:\Users\...\AppData\Local` | `~/.local/share` |
| `${TEMP}` | Temp directory | `C:\Users\...\AppData\Local\Temp` | `/tmp` |

### Custom Variables

Any environment variable can be referenced. If the variable is not found, it is left unchanged:

```toml
[certificate]
# Uses environment variable MY_CUSTOM_CN if set
common_name = "${MY_CUSTOM_CN}"
```

### Examples

```toml
# Machine certificate CN with domain
common_name = "${COMPUTERNAME}.${USERDNSDOMAIN}"
# Result: DESKTOP-ABC123.corp.contoso.com

# Machine account username (Active Directory style)
username = "${COMPUTERNAME}$"
# Result: DESKTOP-ABC123$

# Subject Alternative Names
dns = ["${COMPUTERNAME}.${USERDNSDOMAIN}", "${COMPUTERNAME}"]
# Result: ["DESKTOP-ABC123.corp.contoso.com", "DESKTOP-ABC123"]
```

## Configuration Sections

### [server]

EST server connection settings.

```toml
[server]
# EST server URL (required, must be HTTPS)
url = "https://est.example.com"

# Optional CA label for multi-CA deployments
# When set, URLs become: /.well-known/est/{ca_label}/{operation}
ca_label = "machines"

# Request timeout in seconds (default: 60)
timeout_seconds = 60

# Enable TLS channel binding per RFC 7030 Section 3.5
# Places tls-unique value in CSR challenge-password field
channel_binding = true
```

### [trust]

Server certificate trust verification.

```toml
[trust]
# Trust mode: "webpki", "explicit", "bootstrap", or "insecure"
mode = "explicit"

# Path to CA certificate bundle (PEM format)
# Required when mode is "explicit"
ca_bundle_path = "C:\\ProgramData\\EST\\ca-bundle.pem"

# Expected CA fingerprint for bootstrap mode
# Format: SHA-256 hash with optional colons
bootstrap_fingerprint = "sha256:AB:CD:EF:01:23:45:67:89:..."
```

**Trust Modes:**

- **`webpki`**: Use Mozilla's root CA store (default, suitable for public CAs)
- **`explicit`**: Use specific CA certificates from `ca_bundle_path` (recommended for enterprise)
- **`bootstrap`**: Trust-On-First-Use with fingerprint verification (initial setup only)
- **`insecure`**: Accept any certificate (TESTING ONLY, never use in production)

### [authentication]

Authentication credentials for EST server.

```toml
[authentication]
# Authentication method: "none", "http_basic", "client_cert", or "auto"
method = "auto"

# --- HTTP Basic Authentication ---
username = "${COMPUTERNAME}$"
password_source = "env:EST_PASSWORD"

# --- Client Certificate Authentication ---
# Option 1: Windows certificate store (Windows only)
cert_store = "LocalMachine\\My"
cert_thumbprint = "auto"  # or specific thumbprint

# Option 2: PEM files
cert_path = "C:\\ProgramData\\EST\\client.pem"
key_path = "C:\\ProgramData\\EST\\client.key"
```

**Authentication Methods:**

- **`none`**: No authentication (rarely used, only for open enrollment)
- **`http_basic`**: Username/password in Authorization header
- **`client_cert`**: TLS client certificate (mutual TLS)
- **`auto`**: Try client_cert first, fallback to http_basic

**Password Sources:**

- **`env:VARIABLE_NAME`**: Read from environment variable
- **`file:/path/to/file`**: Read from file (first line, trimmed)
- **`credential_manager`**: Windows Credential Manager (Windows only, planned)

### [certificate]

Certificate request configuration (subject, SANs, extensions).

```toml
[certificate]
# Subject Distinguished Name fields
common_name = "${COMPUTERNAME}.${USERDNSDOMAIN}"  # Required
organization = "Example Corporation"
organizational_unit = "IT Department"
country = "US"  # ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code
state = "Virginia"
locality = "Arlington"

[certificate.san]
# Subject Alternative Names
dns = [
    "${COMPUTERNAME}.${USERDNSDOMAIN}",
    "${COMPUTERNAME}",
    "alias.example.com"
]
ip = ["192.168.1.100", "10.0.1.100"]
include_ip = true  # Auto-detect local IPs

[certificate.key]
# Key algorithm: "ecdsa-p256", "ecdsa-p384", "rsa-2048", "rsa-3072", "rsa-4096"
algorithm = "ecdsa-p256"

# Key provider: "software", "cng", "tpm", "pkcs11"
provider = "software"

# Mark private key as non-exportable (CNG/TPM only)
non_exportable = true

# Enable TPM key attestation (requires server support)
attestation = false

[certificate.extensions]
# Key usage flags
key_usage = ["digital_signature", "key_encipherment"]

# Extended key usage OIDs
extended_key_usage = ["client_auth", "server_auth"]
```

**Key Algorithms:**

- **`ecdsa-p256`**: ECDSA with P-256 curve (recommended, fast, small keys)
- **`ecdsa-p384`**: ECDSA with P-384 curve (higher security)
- **`rsa-2048`**: RSA 2048-bit (legacy compatibility)
- **`rsa-3072`**: RSA 3072-bit (balanced)
- **`rsa-4096`**: RSA 4096-bit (maximum security, slower)

**Key Providers:**

- **`software`**: In-memory or file-based keys (cross-platform)
- **`cng`**: Windows Cryptography Next Generation (Windows only, Phase 11.2)
- **`tpm`**: Trusted Platform Module (hardware-backed, Phase 11.2)
- **`pkcs11`**: PKCS#11 HSM (hardware security module, Phase 11.2)

**Extended Key Usage:**

- `server_auth`: TLS server authentication
- `client_auth`: TLS client authentication
- `code_signing`: Code signing
- `email_protection`: S/MIME email
- `time_stamping`: Timestamping
- `ocsp_signing`: OCSP response signing
- `smart_card_logon`: Smart card logon (Windows)

### [renewal]

Automatic certificate renewal settings.

```toml
[renewal]
# Enable automatic renewal
enabled = true

# Days before expiration to trigger renewal
threshold_days = 30

# Hours between certificate expiration checks
check_interval_hours = 6

# Maximum renewal retry attempts
max_retries = 5

# Minutes between retry attempts (base for exponential backoff)
retry_delay_minutes = 30
```

**Renewal Logic:**

1. Background service checks certificate expiration every `check_interval_hours`
2. If certificate expires within `threshold_days`, renewal is triggered
3. If renewal fails, retry with exponential backoff (base = `retry_delay_minutes`)
4. After `max_retries` failures, log error and wait until next check interval

### [storage]

Certificate and key storage configuration.

```toml
[storage]
# --- Windows Certificate Store (Windows only) ---
windows_store = "LocalMachine\\My"
friendly_name = "EST Machine Certificate"

# --- PEM Files (cross-platform) ---
cert_path = "C:\\ProgramData\\EST\\machine.pem"
key_path = "C:\\ProgramData\\EST\\machine.key"
chain_path = "C:\\ProgramData\\EST\\chain.pem"

# Archive old certificates instead of deleting
archive_old = true
```

**Windows Certificate Stores:**

- `LocalMachine\My`: Computer certificate store (recommended for machine certs)
- `LocalMachine\Root`: Trusted root CAs
- `CurrentUser\My`: User certificate store
- `LocalMachine\TrustedPublisher`: Trusted publishers

### [logging]

Logging and monitoring configuration.

```toml
[logging]
# Log level: "debug", "info", "warn", "error"
level = "info"

# Log file path
path = "C:\\ProgramData\\EST\\logs\\est-enroll.log"

# Enable Windows Event Log integration (Windows only)
windows_event_log = true

# Enable JSON formatted logging (for log aggregation)
json_format = false

# Log rotation settings
max_size_mb = 10
max_files = 5
```

### [service]

Windows Service configuration (Windows only).

```toml
[service]
# Service start type: "automatic", "delayed", "manual", "disabled"
start_type = "automatic"

# Service account
run_as = "LocalSystem"  # or "NetworkService", "DOMAIN\\ServiceAccount"

# Service dependencies (must start before this service)
dependencies = ["Tcpip", "Dnscache"]

# Health check HTTP port (optional)
health_check_port = 8080
```

## Deployment Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Domain Workstations

Replace ADCS auto-enrollment for Windows domain workstations.

**Requirements:**
- Machine certificates with domain FQDN
- Windows certificate store integration
- Automatic renewal
- Windows Event Log monitoring

**Configuration:** See [workstation.toml](../examples/config/workstation.toml)

**Key Features:**
- Uses `${COMPUTERNAME}$` as username (machine account style)
- Stores certificate in `LocalMachine\My` with friendly name
- Enables Windows Event Log for centralized monitoring
- Auto-renewal 45 days before expiration
- Client certificate re-enrollment after initial HTTP Basic enrollment

### Scenario 2: Web Servers

TLS certificates for web servers with multiple DNS names.

**Requirements:**
- Multiple Subject Alternative Names (SANs)
- RSA 2048 for broad compatibility
- TPM key protection (if available)
- Longer renewal threshold to avoid service disruption

**Configuration:** See [server.toml](../examples/config/server.toml)

**Key Features:**
- Multiple DNS SANs including wildcards
- Specific IP addresses for direct access
- TPM-backed keys with attestation
- 60-day renewal threshold (earlier than workstations)
- JSON logging for SIEM integration

### Scenario 3: Kiosks and Embedded Devices

Minimal configuration for resource-constrained devices.

**Requirements:**
- Simple certificate with hostname only
- No Windows-specific features
- Low log verbosity
- Extended check intervals to reduce overhead

**Configuration:** See [kiosk.toml](../examples/config/kiosk.toml)

**Key Features:**
- Uses webpki trust (simpler deployment)
- Software key provider (no HSM required)
- Warn-level logging only
- 24-hour check interval (vs 6 hours for workstations)

### Scenario 4: Initial Bootstrap

First-time enrollment when CA certificate is unknown.

```toml
[server]
url = "https://est.newdeployment.com"

[trust]
# Bootstrap mode - TOFU with fingerprint verification
mode = "bootstrap"
bootstrap_fingerprint = "sha256:AB:CD:EF:01:23:45:67:89:..."

[authentication]
method = "http_basic"
username = "bootstrap-account"
password_source = "env:BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD"

[certificate]
common_name = "${COMPUTERNAME}.newdeployment.com"
```

**Important:** After successful bootstrap, switch to `explicit` trust mode with the retrieved CA certificate. Never use `bootstrap` mode in production long-term.

## Windows Integration

### Windows Certificate Store

When `storage.windows_store` is configured, certificates are stored in the Windows certificate store instead of PEM files.

**Benefits:**
- Native Windows integration (IIS, RDP, etc. can use the certificate)
- Private key protected by Windows DPAPI
- Certificate UI visible in MMC (certlm.msc)
- Support for friendly names and certificate properties

**Implementation Status:** Phase 11.2 (planned)

### Windows CNG (Cryptography Next Generation)

When `certificate.key.provider = "cng"`, private keys are stored using Windows CNG.

**Benefits:**
- Hardware-backed key storage (if TPM available)
- Non-exportable keys (cannot be copied)
- Integration with Windows security policies
- Audit logging of key operations

**Implementation Status:** Phase 11.2 (planned)

### Trusted Platform Module (TPM)

When `certificate.key.provider = "tpm"`, private keys are stored in the TPM.

**Benefits:**
- Hardware root of trust
- Keys never leave the TPM chip
- Attestation capabilities (prove key is TPM-backed)
- Resistance to software attacks

**Requirements:**
- TPM 2.0 chip
- Windows 10/11 or Linux with tpm2-tools

**Implementation Status:** Phase 11.2 (planned)

### Windows Service

The enrollment client runs as a Windows Service for automatic background operation.

**Service Name:** `EST-Enrollment` (planned)

**Service Features:**
- Automatic startup on boot
- Runs as LocalSystem (or configured account)
- Monitors certificate expiration in background
- Integrates with Windows Event Log
- Supports service dependencies (e.g., wait for network)

**Implementation Status:** Phase 11.3 (planned)

### Windows Event Log

When `logging.windows_event_log = true`, events are written to Windows Event Log.

**Event Sources:**
- **Information**: Successful enrollment, renewal
- **Warning**: Approaching expiration, retry attempts
- **Error**: Enrollment failures, configuration errors

**Event IDs** (planned):
- 1000: Enrollment started
- 1001: Enrollment successful
- 1002: Enrollment failed
- 2000: Renewal started
- 2001: Renewal successful
- 2002: Renewal failed
- 3000: Configuration loaded
- 3001: Configuration error

**Implementation Status:** Phase 11.4 (planned)

## Security Considerations

### Protecting Credentials

**HTTP Basic Authentication:**

1. **Never hardcode passwords** in configuration files
2. Use `password_source = "env:VARIABLE"` and set via Group Policy or deployment script
3. Or use `password_source = "credential_manager"` for Windows Credential Manager
4. Restrict file permissions on config file (administrators only)

**Client Certificate Authentication:**

1. Use Windows certificate store with private key marked non-exportable
2. Or use TPM-backed keys that cannot be extracted
3. Protect PEM key files with strict ACLs (SYSTEM and Administrators only)

### Trust Anchor Protection

**Explicit Trust:**

1. Distribute CA certificate bundle via Group Policy or deployment automation
2. Store in protected location (e.g., `C:\ProgramData\EST\ca-bundle.pem`)
3. Set ACL to read-only for SYSTEM and Administrators
4. Verify integrity with file hash or signature

**Bootstrap Mode:**

1. **Only use for initial setup**, never in production
2. Always verify fingerprint from trusted out-of-band source
3. After bootstrap, switch to explicit trust mode
4. Delete bootstrap configuration after migration

### Network Security

1. **Always use HTTPS** (RFC 7030 requirement)
2. Enable TLS channel binding if server supports it
3. Consider network segmentation (EST server on management VLAN)
4. Use firewall rules to restrict EST client network access

### Key Protection

**Minimum Requirements:**
- Use `non_exportable = true` for Windows CNG keys
- Use `provider = "tpm"` for highest security
- Never log or display private keys
- Rotate keys on renewal (default behavior)

**Defense in Depth:**
- Combine client cert auth + HTTP Basic for two-factor enrollment
- Use short certificate lifetimes (e.g., 90 days) for frequent rotation
- Enable audit logging for key operations
- Monitor for anomalous enrollment activity

## Troubleshooting

### Configuration Validation

Run the enrollment client with `--validate-config` to check for errors:

```powershell
# Windows
est-enroll.exe --validate-config

# Linux
est-enroll --validate-config
```

**Common Validation Errors:**
- `server.url is required`: Missing or empty server URL
- `server.url must be HTTPS`: URL uses http:// instead of https://
- `username is required when method is http_basic`: Missing HTTP Basic credentials
- `password_source is required`: Missing password source for HTTP Basic auth

### Variable Expansion Issues

Enable debug logging to see expanded values:

```toml
[logging]
level = "debug"
```

Look for log entries like:
```
Expanded common_name: DESKTOP-ABC123.corp.contoso.com
```

**Common Issues:**
- `${USERDNSDOMAIN}` is empty: Machine not joined to domain, or domain suffix not set
- `${COMPUTERNAME}` contains unexpected value: Check `COMPUTERNAME` environment variable

### Connection Failures

**Symptoms:**
- Error: "Failed to connect to EST server"
- Error: "SSL/TLS handshake failed"

**Troubleshooting:**
1. Verify EST server URL is correct and accessible:
   ```powershell
   curl https://est.example.com/.well-known/est/cacerts
   ```

2. Check trust anchor configuration:
   ```powershell
   # Verify CA bundle file exists and is valid
   openssl x509 -in C:\ProgramData\EST\ca-bundle.pem -text -noout
   ```

3. Test TLS connection:
   ```powershell
   # Windows
   Test-NetConnection -ComputerName est.example.com -Port 443
   ```

4. Check firewall and proxy settings

### Authentication Failures

**Symptoms:**
- Error: "401 Unauthorized"
- Error: "Failed to authenticate with EST server"

**Troubleshooting:**

**For HTTP Basic:**
1. Verify credentials are correct:
   ```powershell
   # Check environment variable is set
   echo $env:EST_PASSWORD
   ```

2. Test credentials manually:
   ```powershell
   $cred = Get-Credential
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://est.example.com/.well-known/est/cacerts -Credential $cred
   ```

**For Client Certificate:**
1. Verify certificate exists in store or file:
   ```powershell
   # Windows Store
   Get-ChildItem Cert:\LocalMachine\My

   # PEM file
   openssl x509 -in client.pem -text -noout
   ```

2. Check certificate is not expired:
   ```powershell
   openssl x509 -in client.pem -noout -dates
   ```

3. Verify private key matches certificate:
   ```powershell
   # Extract public key from cert and key, compare
   openssl x509 -in client.pem -pubkey -noout > cert-pub.pem
   openssl pkey -in client.key -pubout > key-pub.pem
   diff cert-pub.pem key-pub.pem
   ```

### Enrollment Errors

**Error: "CSR generation failed"**
- Check certificate configuration (common_name, organization, etc.)
- Verify key algorithm is supported
- If using HSM: ensure key provider is accessible

**Error: "Server returned 202 Accepted"**
- Enrollment is pending manual approval on server
- Check `Retry-After` header for when to retry
- Contact EST server administrator

**Error: "Certificate parsing failed"**
- Server returned invalid response
- Enable debug logging to see raw response
- Check EST server configuration

### Renewal Issues

**Certificate Not Renewing:**

1. Check renewal is enabled:
   ```toml
   [renewal]
   enabled = true
   ```

2. Verify certificate is within renewal threshold:
   ```powershell
   # Check expiration date
   openssl x509 -in machine.pem -noout -dates

   # Calculate days until expiration
   # (Compare with threshold_days in config)
   ```

3. Check renewal service is running:
   ```powershell
   # Windows
   Get-Service EST-Enrollment

   # Linux
   systemctl status est-enrollment
   ```

4. Review logs for renewal attempts and errors

**Renewal Fails with 401:**
- Re-enrollment requires client certificate authentication
- Ensure `authentication.method = "auto"` or `"client_cert"`
- Verify current certificate is in correct location for client auth

### Performance Issues

**High CPU/Memory Usage:**
- Increase `renewal.check_interval_hours` (reduce check frequency)
- Use `logging.level = "warn"` instead of "debug" or "info"
- Check for certificate store corruption (Windows)

**Slow Enrollment:**
- Increase `server.timeout_seconds`
- Check network latency to EST server
- If using HSM: hardware crypto operations may be slow (expected)

### Log Analysis

**Enable Debug Logging:**
```toml
[logging]
level = "debug"
path = "C:\\ProgramData\\EST\\logs\\debug.log"
```

**Key Log Events:**
- `Loading configuration from: ...` - Config file location
- `Expanded variable: ...` - Variable expansion results
- `Connecting to EST server: ...` - Connection attempts
- `HTTP status: ...` - Server responses
- `Enrollment successful` - Successful enrollment
- `Renewal triggered` - Renewal started
- `Certificate expires in X days` - Expiration monitoring

**Log Rotation:**
- Default: 10 MB max size, 5 files
- Configure via `logging.max_size_mb` and `logging.max_files`
- Old logs are automatically rotated when size limit reached
